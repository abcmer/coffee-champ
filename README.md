# Coffee Champ
> Coffee recommendations are just a click away.

Coffee Champ is a small side project meant for me to explore handful of technologies that I find interesting; from Scala to setting up CI/CD. Hopefully this app will grow over time but for time being I am aiming for this to be a simple app where you provide some coffee preferences and a coffee is recommended.
